# IthoWiFi_HRU_datacollector
Script to collect Itho WiFi HRU system values

I have an Itho Daalderop HRU300, and connected it with the Itho WiFi module from Arjen Hiemstra (see https://github.com/arjenhiemstra/ithowifi ).
As the HRU300 is not officially supported, I created some scripts to see which data is available and actually updated.
